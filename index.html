<h1>Pokémon</h1>

<div>Pokémon is a franchise of video games that is developed by Game Freak that involves the player catching and befriending creatures named pokémon which they can use to battle other pokémon in a turn based combat system. The goal of the game is to progress through the map while leveling up your pokémon in order to defeat the 8 gym leaders spread across the map which pose as the main challenge for the player and marks their progress throughout the game. </div>

<h2><u>Battling System</u></h2>

<h3><u>Types</u></h3>

<p>Each Pokémon can have either 1 or 2 types out of the possible 18 types. These types can determine susceptible a pokémon<br>can be to certain attacks, an example of this is water being strong or 'Super Effective' against types such as fire. Due to there<br>being 18 different pokémon types, this has caused the system to become quite intricate, however, it can be put onto a <br><i>slightly simple</i> chart system. </p>

  <li>Attack - Attack or informally Physical Attack, partly determines how much damage a Pokémon deals when using a physical move.</li>
<p></p>  
  <li>Defense - Defence partly determines how much damage a Pokémon receives when it is hit with a physical move.</li>
